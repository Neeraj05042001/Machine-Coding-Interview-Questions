The tabs should switch content when clicked and have a visual indication for the active tab.
Design the structure and functionality of these tabs.

Requirements:

- Implement functionality such that clicking on a tab chnages the displayed
-Ensure code readability, modularity, and appropriate comments.

Bonus:
